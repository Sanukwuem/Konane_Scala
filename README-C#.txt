Project 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment:

In this project, you will need to solve a simple problem in each of four programming languages: Ada, C#, Clojure and Ruby. Each of your programs go from year 2000 through year 2100 and show all the years that does not have any month with five weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) within the range. For example, July 2016 has five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays, and therefore, year 2016 should not be in the result. On the other hand, since there does not exist a month with five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays in year 2012, your result list should include 2012.

Language Used:

C#
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Name: 

weekendC.cs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Compilation Information:

Since this first project was a fairly menial task that had to be solved, and not an extremely intensive project with multiple classes interacting with each other, I felt as though using an online IDE that could compile all four languages was the most efficient thing to do. The IDE that I used to complete this assignment was the free platform provided by codechef.com. They have a very lightweight platform that simplified the task of finding, downloading and using a different compiler or IDE for each of these 4 languages that I have never used before. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages:

C# was by far the most straightforward language in solving this problem, almost equally on par with my experience with Ruby. Since I have a decent history with C and C++, I knew immediately how to go about solving this assignment with C#. C# was the only language to have a familiar for loop to languages that I've used in the past. The built in implementation of the DateTime object made it quite easy to iterate throughout the calendar to check if the last day of a 31 day month landed on a Sunday. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disadvantages:

While the performance of C# seemed very comparable to that of say Ruby, in terms of efficiency it looks like it used around 3x the memory that Ruby used to accomplish the same task. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Statistics of Execution:

Time taken to execute: 0.02s
Memory used: 23.696kB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Likes/Dislikes:

Like I mentioned previously in the advantages section, the obvious reasons for why I like C# comparitavely to the other languages that we had to implement this task in is my background in C and C++. This made the implementation of this in C# incredibly fast and straightforward, unlike some of the others.
